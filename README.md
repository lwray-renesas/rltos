# RLTOS
Lightweight, fully unit-tested, statically allocated RTOS.

## Introduction
This project is used as a development tool, with the hope to better my understanding of:
- RTOS's (by writing one!)
- Embedded systems
- Software testing principles (unit testing embedded environments)
- Software documentation methods
- Software deployment

The aim is to use this project as a way of learning as many skills as possible while writing something that will be hopefully somewhat useful.

## Documentation
